# Waky Bot
---
Waky is a Discord bot that can interact with  [rAthena](https://github.com/rathena/rathena) tables.
You can use in your server, after reading our [license](https://github.com/psychonaut04/WakyBot/blob/master/LICENSE) and can let your players invite it too, as it supports more than one Discord guild.

### Features

  - Search items using [divine-pride](http://divine-pride.net/) api
  - Sync players to Discord from your website as we use [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql)
  - Browse, update, insert and everything that you want can be done in your database using Discord commands.


Not all features are done yet, this first upload is just for testing.
